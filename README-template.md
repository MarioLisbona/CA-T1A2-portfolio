## **Purpose**

The purpse of this website is to both demonstrate the skills i poses in building wesbites that are simple, effective and engaging as well as highlighting my background and soft skills that will compliment the technincal foundations that i am building upon.

## **Functionality / features**

This website is deisgned to be responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop devices. I have created 4 main pages that all follow a similar theme with their banner pictures of nature and the elements. I have used a minimilst design with muted colors with only one highlighting color that is used for links and hover psuedoclasses. This is the same color as i have used for the brackets in my logo.

I have adapted [JavaScript](./README-template.md#useful-resources) that i found on W3Shcools to apply a lightbox for the Blog Photos. I also adapted some JavaScript for a scroll to top button. The four main pages on the website are:

- Landing Page / Home: This is the landing page and has a breif description about myself and a call to action to sign up to my blog.
- About: This page has some information about my previous work history and a section on why i have chosen to transition into tech. It also has a section where visitors can find more information via phone and email links and a link to my resume.
- Projects: This page has 4 preview cards that link to projects i have recelty completed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Blog: This is the blog homepage. It has its own nav bar for navigating to any of the 5 current blog posts as well as preview cards of each blog. Each Blog post has a story a title, sub title and 6 thumnail images at the bottom. The thumbnails can be clicked to open a lightbox showing the full image as well as thumnails and previous/next buttons on the side of the full image.

## **Useful resources**

- [W3 Schools - Lightbox modal](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_lightbox.asp) - I adapted this code to use as the lightbox for the images in each blog post. The javascript function calls are called with onlcick in the HTML - If i have time i plan to migrate these over to the .js file and use event listeners to call the functions.
- [W3 Schools - Scroll to top](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp) - I adapted this code to create a scroll to top button that uses javascript to hide the button untill the window is scrolled down 30px.
- [W3 Schools - smooth Scrolling](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_smooth_scroll.asp#section2) - This simple html declaration allows the scroll to top button to slide up smoothly rather than instatly go to the top of the page. `html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}`
- [icons8](https://icons8.com/) - I used this site for all the icons. I ended up using .png icons because i couldnt download enough .svg files with a free account.
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) I used this as my guide when creating this README.md
- [Media querry for landscape phones](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/) The nav bar was top large on a phone in landscape mode. This was a good reaource for media querries for mobile devides.
