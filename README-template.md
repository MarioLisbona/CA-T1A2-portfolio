## Useful resources

- [W3 Schools - Lightbox modal](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_lightbox.asp) - I adapted this code to use as the lightbox for the images in each blog post. The javascript function calls are called with onlcick in the HTML - If i have time i plan to migrate these over to the .js file and use event listeners to call the functions.
- [W3 Schools - Scroll to top](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp) - I adapted this code to create a scroll to top button that uses javascript to hide the button untill the window is scrolled down 30px.
- [W3 Schools - smooth SCrolling](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_smooth_scroll.asp#section2) - This simple html declaration allows the scroll to top button to slide up smoothly rather than instatly go to the top of the page. `html {
  scroll-behavior: smooth;
}`
- [icons8](https://icons8.com/) - I used this site for all the icons. I ended up using .png icons because i couldnt download enough .svg files with a free account.
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) I used this as my guide when creating this README.md
