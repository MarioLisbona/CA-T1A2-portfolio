        <h3>Check out the projects I have recently completed</h3>
        <p>Over the last few months i've been teaching myself to code and have been working through a few projects on different websites. The projects below have come from two websites, <a href="http://theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> and <a href="http://frontendmentor.io" target="_blank">Front-end Mentor</a></p>
        <p>Going through the material on The Odin Project has allowed me to gain good foundational skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Front-end Mentor has been particularly good in allowing me to learn the skills of looking at a front-end mockup and working out how to create that page. I was only using the free version i didnt have access to the Figma documentation with the exact deatils of eachg project. I feel though that this was good practice in learning to look at deisgns and figruing out by eye how to distance different elements and adjust font sizes to make the HTML look as close as possible to the deisgn breif.</p>

        <h4>Advice Generator calling an API</h4>
        <p>This is a project i recently completed that calls an API and displays a random piece of advice. This is the first time i coded anything to call an API in JavaScript using promises. I adapted the code from a totorial I watched.</p>

        <h4>The Odin Project Assignment</h4>
        <h4>Etch-a-Sketch</h4>
        <p>This was one of the first projects i attempted in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I started it while wheni was 
          stuck at home for two weeks with Covid. I found it really challenging and it took me quite some time but i learnt alot.

        <h4>Article preview with tooltip</h4>
        <p>I found creating the layout on this page a little tricky. It contains a dynamic tool tip that will stay over the arrow when the browser is resized. I adapted the JavaScript from a tutorial on tooltips that i found on YouTube.</p>

        <h4>Signup Form with form validation</h4>
        <p>I found this project quite challenging. I had to do some research on Regex and validation techniques. The script will provide an error message to the user epending on whether the inputs are empty or invalid.</p>
