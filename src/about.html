            <h1>Mario Lisbona</h1>
            <h2>Previous Work</h2>
            <p>For the last 12 years I'v worked as a Satellite Link opeartor and camerman at Network TEN. I had a proven history of creating and delivering high-quality content to strict deadlines, and I am experienced in many creative and technical aspects of production including shooting, lighting, satellite uplinking and RF transmission. As news gatheres we were often thrust into high pressure situations in unfamiliar environments including major bushfires, floods and other situations where emotions are high. Over the years in that job I developed skills that allow me to think fast and on the fly, adapt to changing conditions and learn how to triage and prioritise activities under pressure.</p>
            <h2>From media to tech</h2>
            <p>I completed a Bachelor of Information Systems when I first left school. Life took me in anothe direction after graduating and I started working in the live events industry and then moved into live television. Over the last year, during covid lockdowns, I revistsed my IT background and started coding again and found myself engrosed and energised with learning again. I continued my own self learning via <a href="http://theodinproject.com" target="_blank"> The Odin Project</a>, <a href="http://frontendmentor.io" target="_blank"> Frontend Mentor</a> and a tutorial series i purchased call <a href="https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/" target="_blank"> Web Dev Simplified</a> and <a href="https://javascriptsimplified.com/" target="_blank"> JavaScript Simplified</a>.</p>
            <p>My Wife is a project manager at a tech startup. A few of her developers had been students at Coder Academy so she suggested the course to me. I decided to resign from my job and dive in head first for a carrer change!</p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I love being nature whether its the ocean or the mountains. Iv been surfing for ove 20 years and have recently discovered foiling and have fallen in love with a new way to enjoy the ocean. I started snowboarding around the same time I started surfing. Over the last few years I have been introduced to snowboarding the backcountry and love it. Its a game of patience, determination and managing fear. The risks are quite high but the reward is amazing!</p>

        <!-- This section contains 4 children - a heading and 3 other div's Each contains a img, an anchor tag and a p tag. Iv nested those 3 items in a div i could align each of them independently of the contact-container they are house in.  -->
